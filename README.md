# NBA-Analysis-Project

♞ Developed a Python-based analysis pipeline to explore the relationship between assists and efficiency in NBA historical data, leveraging datasets from multiple seasons.

♞ Used Pandas for data cleaning and transformation, ensuring the data was properly structured for analysis by handling missing values, duplicates, and standardizing columns.

♞ Applied Matplotlib to visualize key metrics, generating scatter plots to intuitively display the relationships between assists and other efficiency metrics like Team Efficiency Rating (PER).

♞ Utilized SciPy and NumPy to compute statistical correlations, including Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients, to quantify the strength and direction of the relationship between assists and overall team efficiency.

♞ Conducted regression analysis to identify potential predictive trends, finding that a high number of assists correlates with better team efficiency but with varying impact across different positions.
