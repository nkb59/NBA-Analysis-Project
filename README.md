# NBA-Analysis-Project

● Developed a Python-based analysis pipeline to explore the relationship between assists and overall team efficiency in
NBA historical data, leveraging datasets from multiple seasons

● Utilized Pandas to clean, transform, and preprocess datasets and leveraged Matplotlib for regression analysis to
visualize relationships via scatter plots between assists and Team Efficiency Rating

● Demonstrated a strong linear relationship within data through a high Pearson R coefficient, while identifying potential
non-linear patterns or outliers via a low Spearman p-value
